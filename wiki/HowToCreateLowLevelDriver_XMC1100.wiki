= Introduction =

This chapter explain you how to create the Low Level Driver for XMC1100 via DAvE.

You need:
 * The board: Infineon XMC1100 Boot Kit or Infineon XMC1300 Boot Kit
 * Environment: DAVE™ – Free Development Platform for Code Generation (DAVE™ 3.1.8 or later) 


= STEP 1 - Create the DAvE CE project =

By 'File->New' (or ALT+SHIFT+N) create a new DAvE CE project:
 * Project Name: 'Arduino_XMC1300_LowLevelDriver'
 * DAVE CE Project setting
 * Processor Info: XMC1302-TO38X0200

After pressing 'Finish', you''l get your empty project:

= STEP 2 - Create the Wiring_time Low Level driver =
== STEP 2.a - Add 'SYSTM002' Application ==
In order to support the 'delay()', 'millis()', ... functions, it is needed to add the 'SYSTM002' application. To do this, type 'SYSTM002' in the 'App Selection View - Search filter':

then double click on the 'SYSTM002[1.0.0]' application in order to add one instance to your project. You'll get this in the 'S/W App Connectivy View':

Now, just to double check that the default setting have not been changed in your DAvE latest release, just double click on the 'SYSTM002/0' image (ref. A), you must have (ref.B):

Now, double click on the 'CLK002/0' image (ref. A), you must set 'PCLK= 2*MCLK' (ref.B):

== STEP 2.b - Add 'PWMSP001' Application ==
In order to support the 'delayMicroseconds()' function, it is needed to add the 'PWMSP001' application. To do this, type 'PWMSP001' in the 'App Selection View - Search filter'. Then double click on the 'PWMSP001[1.0.26]' application in order to add one instance to your project. You'll get this in the 'S/W App Connectivy View':

Now, just to double check that the default setting have not been changed in your DAvE latest release, just double click on the 'PWMSP001/0' image (ref. C), you must have (ref.D).
